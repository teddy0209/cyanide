## Project status

Cyanide is now actively maintained by `Nnnnnnn274` but it is no longer the original this is my fork!

## Goals

Make tweaks more stable and continue the old unfinished tweaks.
Make new tweaks and stuff.
Add new exploits.
And make the experience better!

<h1 align="center">Cyanide</h1>

**By [@zeroxjf](https://github.com/zeroxjf)** — an iOS tweak runner built on top of the DarkSword kernel r/w primitive.

Cyanide is a fork of [`wh1te4ever/darksword-kexploit-fun`](https://github.com/wh1te4ever/darksword-kexploit-fun)
for iOS kernel research. It wraps the native DarkSword kernel stages in an
Objective-C iOS app, restructures the UI as an Installer/Settings split, and
adds a few reliability fixes for repeated local testing. It does not ship
the browser-delivered WebKit/dyld parts of the original DarkSword chain.

## Project Status

As of v1.3.6, Patreon integration has been removed. All installable Cyanide
tweaks are free and no tweak access depends on account linking.

Previously unreleased work-in-progress tweak code has been opened under the
same AGPL-3.0 license as the rest of the project. Some unfinished entries remain
visible in the app so contributors can find them, but installation stays
disabled until someone finishes and verifies them.

`zeroxjf` is stepping away from active Cyanide development. The code is now
open under AGPL-3.0 so anyone can fork it, study it, reuse it, or continue it
under the license terms.

## Beta Tweaks

Beta tweaks are free and visible without account linking. They are unstable and
intended for testers who are comfortable with SpringBoard glitches, crashes, or
partial behavior.

## Tweaks

These tweaks have been tested on iOS 18.x and 26.x. Expect version drift in
SpringBoard and related daemons to break things on other releases.

### Status Bar

- **StatBar**: battery temperature and free-RAM overlay anchored to the
  SpringBoard status bar, with optional C/F and network-speed display.
- **NSBar**: compact live download/upload speed overlay for the status bar,
  with selectable corner/center positions. Ported from
  [`d1y/cyanide-ios`](https://github.com/d1y/cyanide-ios).
- **NiceBar Lite**: configurable status-bar-adjacent labels for custom text,
  date/time formats, battery, memory, traffic, uptime, IP address, disk,
  thermal state, and other live readouts. Ported from
  [`d1y/cyanide-ios`](https://github.com/d1y/cyanide-ios).

### Home Screen Layout

- **SBCustomizer**: dock icon count, home-screen columns/rows, and hidden icon
  labels.
- **Home Layout Extras**: extra padding around the home grid and dock, plus
  per-icon scale for home and dock icons. Stacks on top of SBCustomizer.

### Performance

- **Powercuff**: CPU/GPU underclocking through simulated `thermalmonitord`
  pressure levels (off, nominal, light, moderate, heavy). Lasts until reboot.
  Port of [`rpetrich/Powercuff`](https://github.com/rpetrich/Powercuff).

### SpringBoard Tweaks

Ported from [`kolbicz/DarkSword-Tweaks`](https://github.com/kolbicz/DarkSword-Tweaks):

- **Disable App Library**: removes the App Library page past the last home screen.
- **Disable Icon Fly-In**: skips the spring-in animation when icons appear.
- **Zero Wake Animation**: snaps the display on instantly when waking.
- **Zero Backlight Fade**: instant lock/unlock backlight.
- **Double-Tap to Lock**: lock the device with a wallpaper double-tap.

### System Updates

- **Disable OTA Updates**: toggles the launchd OTA `disabled.plist` to block or
  unblock update prompts. Persists across reboots.

### Beta

> ⚠︎ Work in progress — these may crash SpringBoard, glitch layout, work only
> partially, or need re-applying between builds.

- **Gravity Lite**: core port of Julio Verne's classic Gravity tweak. Applies
  UIDynamicAnimator physics to home-screen and dock icons — gravity, collisions,
  bounce, friction, accelerometer steering, shake pulses, and an explosion
  button. Use Restore Icon Layout if icons stay displaced after deactivating.
- **Axon Lite**: groups Notification Center requests by app with a SpringBoard
  overlay and dedups duplicates while the RemoteCall session is alive.
- **Dynamic Stage Lite**: brings Stage Manager-style split-view to iPhone over
  RemoteCall — no jailbreak required. Hosts a second app's scene alongside
  SpringBoard using the same scene-hosting design as [`tomt000`'s Dynamic Stage](https://havoc.app/package/dynamicstage).
- **FastLockX Lite**: keeps Face ID retry/unlock requests armed through
  SpringBoard timers so pickup-to-unlock can work after Cyanide closes.
- **Cyanide Themer**: per-bundle icon theme engine. Walks SpringBoard's
  SBIconView hierarchy and swaps each icon's image with a PNG matched on bundle
  ID. Ships with iOS 6 Theme; also accepts a custom folder of `<bundleID>.png`
  files or a binary plist. Pick a theme in Settings before running.
- **SnowBoard Lite**: imports SnowBoard/IconBundles-style theme folders or
  archives into Cyanide's local theme library, then applies the selected theme
  through the existing icon replacement pipeline. Ported from
  [`d1y/cyanide-ios`](https://github.com/d1y/cyanide-ios).
- **LiveWP**: copies a selected MP4/MOV/M4V into Cyanide's app container and
  plays it behind SpringBoard's home and lock screen windows while the live
  RemoteCall session is active. Ported from
  [`d1y/cyanide-ios`](https://github.com/d1y/cyanide-ios).
- **Watch Pairing Override**: edits the watchOS pairing range stored on the
  iPhone so you can pair a newer Apple Watch or revive an older one. Persists
  across reboots; respring before pairing.
- **Location Simulator**: drives Apple's CoreLocation simulation path from a
  RemoteCall host process and sets a static target coordinate. Simulated
  locations may violate app terms, platform rules, game rules, ride-share or
  delivery policies, or local law depending on how they are used. Use only where
  you have permission; you are responsible for your use and apply or restore it
  at your own risk. It may also affect location-tied system behavior such as
  time zone/date/time handling and can have unintended consequences; only use it
  if you know what you're doing. Credits: `kolbicz` provided the
  RemoteCall/CLSimulationManager GPS spoofer prototype, and `ezzuldinSt`'s
  LSpoof provided the app-side spoofing, picker, bookmarks, and route-simulation
  reference.
- **Call Recording Sound**: replaces the CallServices
  `StartDisclosureWithTone` and `StopDisclosure` audio files with Cyanide's
  bundled silent payloads, with separate Silence and Restore actions. Cyanide
  backs up the first originals into its app container before replacement, but
  this is still a persistent system-file edit under
  `/var/mobile/Library/CallServices/Greetings/default`. Disclosure sounds may be
  legally required where you live; you are responsible for your use and should
  restore the originals before removing Cyanide if you want Cyanide's backups
  written back. Credits: `YangJiiii` (`@duongduong0908`) for the EnsWilde and
  Disable Call Recording BookRestore reference tools, and `@Little_34306` as
  credited by the original projects for the Disable Call Recording concept.

### In Development

> These entries are visible but not installable because they do not work yet.
> Their app/source paths are left in place so someone can pick them up later.

- **Signal Readouts**: unfinished status-bar numeric signal readouts.
- **TypeBanner**: unfinished iMessage typing banner experiment.
- **Notification Island**: unfinished Dynamic Island notification mirror.
- **IPA Decryptor**: unfinished local IPA decryptor workflow.

## Supported Targets

Tested target range:

- iOS/iPadOS 17.0 through 18.7.1
- iOS/iPadOS 26.0 through 26.0.1
- A19/M5 devices are not supported

The kernel bugs used here, `CVE-2025-43510` and `CVE-2025-43520`, were fixed in
iOS/iPadOS 18.7.2 and 26.1. Later builds are outside this kernel exploit window.

## What This Fork Changes

- Cleans shared exploit state before each attempt.
- Matches the target process with an explicit marker.
- Validates sockets before using the spray path.
- Treats missed races as retryable failures instead of hard failures.
- Tightens the A18/M4 `pe_v2` path with initialized target-file contents,
  stable local remap addresses, bounded page freeing, socket-spray preflight
  checks, and controlled zone-trim retries.

## Kernel Research Features

- Escape the app sandbox.
- Control or crash userspace processes from the app.
- Change UID, GID, and sticky bits on target files.
- Disable ASLR by setting `P_DISABLE_ASLR` in `launchd`'s `proc->p_flag`.

### UI inspiration

- The classic [Installer.app](https://github.com/AppTapp/Installer-3) (Ripdev & Nullriver Software, now maintained by AppTapp and the Legacy Jailbreak community) — the iPhoneOS 1 package-manager look that the Cyanide Installer tab is modeled after.
- The [Sileo Project](https://github.com/Sileo/Sileo) (the Sileo Team) — the queue → review → confirm install flow and the bottom queue-popup pattern.

## Build

```sh
./scripts/build.sh
```

The build script uses the `Cyanide` scheme, disables code signing, and writes
an unsigned IPA to:

```text
build/Cyanide.ipa
```

Equivalent manual build:

```sh
xcodebuild \
  -project Cyanide.xcodeproj \
  -scheme Cyanide \
  -sdk iphoneos \
  -configuration Debug \
  CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO \
  build
```

## License

This repository is licensed under **AGPL-3.0**. See `LICENSE`.

The NSBar, NiceBar Lite, SnowBoard Lite, and LiveWP ports adapt AGPL-3.0 code
from [`d1y/cyanide-ios`](https://github.com/d1y/cyanide-ios) and remain in the
AGPL-covered tree.

## JavaScript Tweaks

Cyanide includes two JavaScript tweak runners contributed by Iggy05:

- **QuickLoader** imports a local `.js` file from Files and exposes declared
  `@param` values as settings rows.
- **RepoTweaks Store** imports HTTPS JSON repositories and downloads selected
  JavaScript tweaks from those sources. Cyanide seeds the zeroxjf source at
  `https://zeroxjf.github.io/cyanide-repotweaks.json` by default.

Only run scripts and repositories you trust; JavaScript tweaks can call Cyanide
RemoteCall helpers and may destabilize SpringBoard if the script is buggy.

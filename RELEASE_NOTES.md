# Release Notes

Keep concrete, user-facing release bullets here as changes land. The release
script reads `## Pending` before building, uses those bullets for GitHub release
notes and the generated in-app changelog, then moves them under `## Released`
after a successful build.

Good bullets describe the behavior users will notice:

- Reduced flicker when Dynamic Stage windows resize.
- Fixed installer queue badges after changing package selection.
- Added an iOS 17 fallback for Disable App Library.

Use one bullet per user-facing tweak or fix. Do not combine unrelated tweak
changes into the same bullet.

Avoid vague bullets like "Update settings", "Change project files", or
"Misc fixes".

It is OK to mention user-visible beta or experimental tweaks when describing
added or improved features. Credit original tweak or project authors alongside
the Cyanide port author when known. Do not mention experimental source movement,
non-public repository names, non-public implementation details, or commentary
about which experimental pieces are working versus not wired. If the change
cannot be phrased as a user-facing feature or fix without revealing internal
activity, omit it.

## Released

### v1.3.6 - 2026-06-27

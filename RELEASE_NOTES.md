# Release Notes

Keep concrete, user-facing release bullets here as changes land. The release
script reads `## Pending` before building, uses those bullets for GitHub release
notes and the generated in-app changelog, then moves them under `## Released`
after a successful build.

Good bullets describe the behavior users will notice:

- Reduced flicker when Dynamic Stage windows resize.
- Fixed installer queue badges after changing package selection.
- Added an iOS 17 fallback for Disable App Library.

Avoid vague bullets like "Update settings", "Change project files", or
"Misc fixes".

## Pending


## Released

### v1.2.1 - 2026-06-03

- [x] Added Drag Coefficient tweak — custom SpringBoard animation speed multiplier ported from kolbicz/DarkSword-Tweaks, with a 5–200% slider (50% = 2× faster, 100% = stock).

### v1.2.0 - 2026-06-03

- [x] Added Gravity Lite with home screen and dock icon physics, tilt control, widget support, and iOS 18/26 compatibility.
- [x] Polished installer, settings, and log presentation with clearer status text, cleaner startup branding, and a maintained release-notes workflow.
